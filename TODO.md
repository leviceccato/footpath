A list of complete and incomplete tasks to track progress on Lacey.

## To do (lowest to highest priority)

- Add syntax highlighting
- Fix code documents/tabs
- Add tooltips for language and colour picker buttons
- Fix modal background contrast for dark colours
- Create favicon
- Optimise computed values to potentially use createMemo across codebase
- Add hex input for colour picker
- Add global activeCodeDocument property and remove individual isActive
- Expose composables as namespaced objects, rather for destructuring (e.g. useCodeDocuments)
- Expose components in their own files (e.g. useIcons should not return Icon)
- Nest extended component props in object, rather than spreading them into props (e.g. ButtonProps)

## Doing

- Refactor Popover to support mulitple popovers per button

## Done (most recent to oldest)

- Match scrollbar style to theme
- Make code editor async
- Add new defaultProps utility
- Allow dragging outside colour picker
- Prevent tabbing out of code editor
